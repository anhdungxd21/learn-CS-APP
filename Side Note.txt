Pointer
	-> Pointers are a central feature of C. They provide the mechanism for referencing elements of data
		structures, including arrays. Just like a variable, a pointer has two aspects: its value and its type. The
		value indicates the location of some object, while its type indicates what kind of object (e.g., integer or
		floating-point number) is stored at that location.
			Truly understanding pointers requires examining their representation and implementation at the
		machine level.
